# linux上的线程实现
glibc提供了linux上的线程实现：
* LinuxThreads
      This is the original Pthreads implementation.  Since glibc 2.4, this implementation is no longer supported.
* NPTL (Native POSIX Threads Library)
      This  is  the  modern Pthreads implementation.  By comparison with LinuxThreads, NPTL provides closer conformance to the requirements of the POSIX.1 specification and better performance when creating large numbers of
      threads.  NPTL is available since glibc 2.3.2, and requires features that are present in the Linux 2.6 kernel.

两种都是1:1实现，也即每个线程都对应着内核的一个调度实体。 两个实现都是用 clone(2)调用。
NTPL中的同步原语（mutexes、thread joining等）是通过 futex(2)调用实现。

详见 `man pthreads`

## pthread_create

签名
```c
#include <pthread.h>

int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr,
                  void *(*start_routine) (void *), void *arg);

// Compile and link with -pthread.
```

介绍
```
DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_create() function starts a new thread in the calling process.  The new thread starts execution by invoking start_routine(); arg is passed as the sole argument of start_routine().

       The new thread terminates in one of the following ways:

       * It calls pthread_exit(3), specifying an exit status value that is available to another thread in the same process that calls pthread_join(3).

       * It returns from start_routine().  This is equivalent to calling pthread_exit(3) with the value supplied in the return statement.

       * It is canceled (see pthread_cancel(3)).

       * Any of the threads in the process calls exit(3), or the main thread performs a return from main().  This causes the termination of all threads in the process.

       The  attr  argument points to a pthread_attr_t structure whose contents are used at thread creation time to determine attributes for the new thread; this structure is initialized using pthread_attr_init(3) and related func‐
       tions.  If attr is NULL, then the thread is created with default attributes.

       Before returning, a successful call to pthread_create() stores the ID of the new thread in the buffer pointed to by thread; this identifier is used to refer to the thread in subsequent calls to other pthreads functions.

       The new thread inherits a copy of the creating thread's signal mask (pthread_sigmask(3)).  The set of pending signals for the new thread is empty (sigpending(2)).  The new thread  does  not  inherit  the  creating  thread's
       alternate signal stack (sigaltstack(2)).

       The new thread inherits the calling thread's floating-point environment (fenv(3)).

       The initial value of the new thread's CPU-time clock is 0 (see pthread_getcpuclockid(3)).

   Linux-specific details
       The new thread inherits copies of the calling thread's capability sets (see capabilities(7)) and CPU affinity mask (see sched_setaffinity(2)).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, pthread_create() returns 0; on error, it returns an error number, and the contents of *thread are undefined.

ERRORS
       EAGAIN Insufficient  resources  to  create  another  thread,  or  a  system-imposed limit on the number of threads was encountered.  The latter case may occur in two ways: the RLIMIT_NPROC soft resource limit (set via setr‐
              limit(2)), which limits the number of process for a real user ID, was reached; or the kernel's system-wide limit on the number of threads, /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max, was reached.

       EINVAL Invalid settings in attr.

       EPERM  No permission to set the scheduling policy and parameters specified in attr.
```

## pthread_join

签名
```c
#include <pthread.h>

int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **retval);

// Compile and link with -pthread.
```

介绍
```
DESCRIPTION
       The pthread_join() function waits for the thread specified by thread to terminate.  If that thread has already terminated, then pthread_join() returns immediately.  The thread specified by thread must be joinable.

       If  retval is not NULL, then pthread_join() copies the exit status of the target thread (i.e., the value that the target thread supplied to pthread_exit(3)) into the location pointed to by *retval.  If the target thread was
       canceled, then PTHREAD_CANCELED is placed in *retval.

       If multiple threads simultaneously try to join with the same thread, the results are undefined.  If the thread calling pthread_join() is canceled, then the target thread will remain joinable (i.e., it will not be detached).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, pthread_join() returns 0; on error, it returns an error number.

ERRORS
       EDEADLK
              A deadlock was detected (e.g., two threads tried to join with each other); or thread specifies the calling thread.

       EINVAL thread is not a joinable thread.

       EINVAL Another thread is already waiting to join with this thread.

       ESRCH  No thread with the ID thread could be found.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       After a successful call to pthread_join(), the caller is guaranteed that the target thread has terminated.

       Joining with a thread that has previously been joined results in undefined behavior.

       Failure to join with a thread that is joinable (i.e., one that is not detached), produces a "zombie thread".  Avoid doing this, since each zombie thread consumes some system resources, and when enough  zombie  threads  have
       accumulated, it will no longer be possible to create new threads (or processes).

       There is no pthreads analog of waitpid(-1, &status, 0), that is, "join with any terminated thread".  If you believe you need this functionality, you probably need to rethink your application design.

       All of the threads in a process are peers: any thread can join with any other thread in the process.

EXAMPLE
       See pthread_create(3).

# 线程与进程

## 多线程/多进程带来的几个问题
* 共享数据空间 - 多线程
	* 内存malloc和free
	> 留意是否内存被其他线程free而有线程还在使用
	* 静态变量访问
* 共享fd（set） - 多线程/多进程
	* 线程/进程使用的fd被其他线程/进程关闭
	* 并发的读写
* fork、exec、exit
	* 如果一个线程调用了exec，则运行程序被替代的结果之一是所有线程都会消失
	* 如果一个线程执行了exit，整个进程（所有线程）都会退出
	* 一个线程遇到段错误等，crash的是整个进程
	* 对于fork，只有执行fork的线程在子进程中运行，而不包含其他线程
	* fork时如果有其他线程在修改共享数据... = =
* signals
	* 哪些线程可以收到信号量？ 是不是所有线程都可以？
	* 如果信号时因为段错误等引起时又如何？

# 线程间互相通信

## 条件变量
`pthread_cond_t` 需要和 `pthread_mutex_t` 配套使用。
wait/signal
`pthread_cond_wait`执行细节如下：
1. 释放指定的锁
> 如果执行时并没有获得锁的话，**结果是不确定的**
2. 等待条件变量的变化
3. 重新锁住该指定互斥量



```c
pthread_mutex_t lock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
pthread_cond_t flag = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;

pthread_cond_wait(&flag, &lock);

pthread_cond_signal(&flag);

pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);

pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
```
