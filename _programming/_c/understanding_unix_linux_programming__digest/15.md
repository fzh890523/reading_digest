DESCRIPTION
       select()  and  pselect()  allow  a program to monitor multiple file descriptors, waiting until one or more of the file descriptors become "ready" for some class of I/O operation (e.g., input possible).  A file descriptor is
       considered ready if it is possible to perform the corresponding I/O operation (e.g., read(2)) without blocking.

       The operation of select() and pselect() is identical, other than these three differences:

       (i)    select() uses a timeout that is a struct timeval (with seconds and microseconds), while pselect() uses a struct timespec (with seconds and nanoseconds).

       (ii)   select() may update the timeout argument to indicate how much time was left.  pselect() does not change this argument.

       (iii)  select() has no sigmask argument, and behaves as pselect() called with NULL sigmask.

       Three independent sets of file descriptors are watched.  Those listed in readfds will be watched to see if characters become available for reading (more precisely, to see if a read will not  block;  in  particular,  a  file
       descriptor is also ready on end-of-file), those in writefds will be watched to see if a write will not block, and those in exceptfds will be watched for exceptions.  On exit, the sets are modified in place to indicate which
       file descriptors actually changed status.  Each of the three file descriptor sets may be specified as NULL if no file descriptors are to be watched for the corresponding class of events.

       Four macros are provided to manipulate the sets.  FD_ZERO() clears a set.  FD_SET() and FD_CLR() respectively add and remove a given file descriptor from a set.  FD_ISSET() tests to see if a file descriptor is part  of  the
       set; this is useful after select() returns.

       nfds is the highest-numbered file descriptor in any of the three sets, plus 1.

       The  timeout argument specifies the minimum interval that select() should block waiting for a file descriptor to become ready.  (This interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity, and kernel scheduling delays
       mean that the blocking interval may overrun by a small amount.)  If both fields of the timeval structure are zero, then select() returns immediately.  (This is useful for polling.)  If timeout is NULL (no timeout), select()
       can block indefinitely.

       sigmask  is  a pointer to a signal mask (see sigprocmask(2)); if it is not NULL, then pselect() first replaces the current signal mask by the one pointed to by sigmask, then does the "select" function, and then restores the
       original signal mask.

       Other than the difference in the precision of the timeout argument, the following pselect() call:

           ready = pselect(nfds, &readfds, &writefds, &exceptfds,
                           timeout, &sigmask);

       is equivalent to atomically executing the following calls:

           sigset_t origmask;

           pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &sigmask, &origmask);
           ready = select(nfds, &readfds, &writefds, &exceptfds, timeout);
           pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &origmask, NULL);

       The reason that pselect() is needed is that if one wants to wait for either a signal or for a file descriptor to become ready, then an atomic test is needed to prevent race conditions.  (Suppose the signal  handler  sets  a
       global  flag  and  returns.   Then  a test of this global flag followed by a call of select() could hang indefinitely if the signal arrived just after the test but just before the call.  By contrast, pselect() allows one to
       first block signals, handle the signals that have come in, then call pselect() with the desired sigmask, avoiding the race.)

   The timeout
       The time structures involved are defined in <sys/time.h> and look like

           struct timeval {
               long    tv_sec;         /* seconds */
               long    tv_usec;        /* microseconds */
           };

           and

          struct timespec {
              long    tv_sec;         /* seconds */
              long    tv_nsec;        /* nanoseconds */
          };

      (However, see below on the POSIX.1-2001 versions.)

      Some code calls select() with all three sets empty, nfds zero, and a non-NULL timeout as a fairly portable way to sleep with subsecond precision.

      On Linux, select() modifies timeout to reflect the amount of time not slept; most other implementations do not do this.  (POSIX.1-2001 permits either behavior.)  This causes problems both when Linux code which reads timeout
      is ported to other operating systems, and when code is ported to Linux that reuses a struct timeval for multiple select()s in a loop without reinitializing it.  Consider timeout to be undefined after select() returns.

RETURN VALUE
      On  success, select() and pselect() return the number of file descriptors contained in the three returned descriptor sets (that is, the total number of bits that are set in readfds, writefds, exceptfds) which may be zero if
      the timeout expires before anything interesting happens.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately; the sets and timeout become undefined, so do not rely on their contents after an error.

ERRORS
      EBADF  An invalid file descriptor was given in one of the sets.  (Perhaps a file descriptor that was already closed, or one on which an error has occurred.)

      EINTR  A signal was caught; see signal(7).

      EINVAL nfds is negative or the value contained within timeout is invalid.

      ENOMEM unable to allocate memory for internal tables.

## select与talk

## select与poll

# 通信的选择
## 一个问题的三种解决方案

## 通过文件的IPC
> linux并不限制打开同一个文件的进程数目
> 可选的可以在打开时对文件进行加锁

* 访问控制
> 进程对文件的读写权限
* 多客户端
> 多个进程以读方式打开
* 竞态条件
> 如清空-重写时的读操作，可能读到空也可能读到部分内容
* 避免竞态条件
> 如文件锁

## 命名管道
常规管道： 进程创建、最后一个进程关闭。 不出现在FS中
命名管道： 出现在FS中，可以连接不相关进程，可以独立进程存在。 功能类似FIFO。

### 使用
* 创建 - `mkfifo(char * name, mode_t mode)`
* 删除 - `unlink(fifoname)` 和普通文件一样
* 监听 - `open(fifoname, O_RDONLY)`，一直阻塞到有进程以写方式打开FIFO
* 开始会话 - `open(fifoname, O_WRONLY)`，一直阻塞到有进程以读方式打开FIFO
* 通信 - 读写，`read/write`； 结束，`close`（写进程通知读进程）

* 竞态条件 - 在信息长度不超过管道容量的情况下，read和write都是原子操作，读取操作会清空而写入操作又塞满，所以不需要锁
> **#yonka#** 不科学啊，假如管道容量1K写满了，然后read时指定只read 1byte，那writer只能写入1byte就跟其他writers一起block了，之后available会优先考虑那个没写完的writer吗？

### 相关函数 mkfifo
mkfifo - make a FIFO special file (a named pipe)

签名
```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

int mkfifo(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);
```

介绍
```
DESCRIPTION
       mkfifo() makes a FIFO special file with name pathname.  mode specifies the FIFO's permissions.  It is modified by the process's umask in the usual way: the permissions of the created file are (mode & ~umask).

       A FIFO special file is similar to a pipe, except that it is created in a different way.  Instead of being an anonymous communications channel, a FIFO special file is entered into the file system by calling mkfifo().

       Once  you  have created a FIFO special file in this way, any process can open it for reading or writing, in the same way as an ordinary file.  However, it has to be open at both ends simultaneously before you can proceed to
       do any input or output operations on it.  Opening a FIFO for reading normally blocks until some other process opens the same FIFO for writing, and vice versa.  See fifo(7) for nonblocking handling of FIFO special files.

RETURN VALUE
       On success mkfifo() returns 0.  In the case of an error, -1 is returned (in which case, errno is set appropriately).

ERRORS
       EACCES One of the directories in pathname did not allow search (execute) permission.

       EDQUOT The user's quota of disk blocks or inodes on the file system has been exhausted.

       EEXIST pathname already exists.  This includes the case where pathname is a symbolic link, dangling or not.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              Either the total length of pathname is greater than PATH_MAX, or an individual filename component has a length greater than NAME_MAX.  In the GNU system, there is no imposed limit on overall filename length, but some
              file systems may place limits on the length of a component.

       ENOENT A directory component in pathname does not exist or is a dangling symbolic link.

       ENOSPC The directory or file system has no room for the new file.

       ENOTDIR
              A component used as a directory in pathname is not, in fact, a directory.

       EROFS  pathname refers to a read-only file system.

## 共享内存
使用管道需要两次复制数据： 进程A buf -> 管道buf -> 进程B buf。而共享内存不需要。

概念
* 共享内存段不依赖进程存在（类似fifo）
* 共享内存段有自己的名字，称为 key
* key是一个整型数（类似malloc得到的指针）
* 共享内存段有自己的拥有者和权限位（类似文件）

竞态条件
> 并发的读写可能导致读到脏数据
> 本身并不提供机制来避免，可以通过其他机制联合使用（如信号量等）

### 使用

* writer/producer
	1. shmget(IPC_CREAT)
	2. shmat
	3. （使用完）shmctl关闭/删除
* reader/consumer
	1. shmget（一般不创建）
	2. shmat
	3. shmdt（一般不负责删除，detach即可）

### 相关函数 
* shmget - 得到、创建内存段
> 存在则找到位置...； 不存在则根据flags选择创建...
* shmat - 进程连接到某内存段
> map到进程的地址空间，返回指向此段的指针，可以指定是否只读
* strcpy
* memcpy

#### shmget
shmget - allocates a System V shared memory segment

签名
```c
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>

int shmget(key_t key, size_t size, int shmflg);
```

介绍
```
DESCRIPTION
       shmget()  returns the identifier of the System V shared memory segment associated with the value of the argument key.  A new shared memory segment, with size equal to the value of size rounded up to a multiple of PAGE_SIZE,
       is created if key has the value IPC_PRIVATE or key isn't IPC_PRIVATE, no shared memory segment corresponding to key exists, and IPC_CREAT is specified in shmflg.

       If shmflg specifies both IPC_CREAT and IPC_EXCL and a shared memory segment already exists for key, then shmget() fails with errno set to EEXIST.  (This is analogous to the effect of the combination  O_CREAT  |  O_EXCL  for
       open(2).)

       The value shmflg is composed of:

       IPC_CREAT   to create a new segment.  If this flag is not used, then shmget() will find the segment associated with key and check to see if the user has permission to access the segment.

       IPC_EXCL    used with IPC_CREAT to ensure failure if the segment already exists.

       mode_flags  (least significant 9 bits) specifying the permissions granted to the owner, group, and world.  These bits have the same format, and the same meaning, as the mode argument of open(2).  Presently, the execute per‐
                   missions are not used by the system.

       SHM_HUGETLB (since Linux 2.6)
                   Allocate the segment using "huge pages."  See the Linux kernel source file Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt for further information.

       SHM_NORESERVE (since Linux 2.6.15)
                   This flag serves the same purpose as the mmap(2) MAP_NORESERVE flag.  Do not reserve swap space for this segment.  When swap space is reserved, one has the guarantee that it is possible to  modify  the  segment.
                   When swap space is not reserved one might get SIGSEGV upon a write if no physical memory is available.  See also the discussion of the file /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory in proc(5).

       When a new shared memory segment is created, its contents are initialized to zero values, and its associated data structure, shmid_ds (see shmctl(2)), is initialized as follows:

              shm_perm.cuid and shm_perm.uid are set to the effective user ID of the calling process.

              shm_perm.cgid and shm_perm.gid are set to the effective group ID of the calling process.

              The least significant 9 bits of shm_perm.mode are set to the least significant 9 bit of shmflg.

              shm_segsz is set to the value of size.

              shm_lpid, shm_nattch, shm_atime and shm_dtime are set to 0.

              shm_ctime is set to the current time.

       If the shared memory segment already exists, the permissions are verified, and a check is made to see if it is marked for destruction.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, a valid shared memory identifier is returned.  On errir, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       On failure, errno is set to one of the following:

       EACCES The user does not have permission to access the shared memory segment, and does not have the CAP_IPC_OWNER capability.

       EEXIST IPC_CREAT | IPC_EXCL was specified and the segment exists.

       EINVAL A new segment was to be created and size < SHMMIN or size > SHMMAX, or no new segment was to be created, a segment with given key existed, but size is greater than the size of that segment.

       ENFILE The system limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       ENOENT No segment exists for the given key, and IPC_CREAT was not specified.

       ENOMEM No memory could be allocated for segment overhead.

       ENOSPC All possible shared memory IDs have been taken (SHMMNI), or allocating a segment of the requested size would cause the system to exceed the system-wide limit on shared memory (SHMALL).

       EPERM  The SHM_HUGETLB flag was specified, but the caller was not privileged (did not have the CAP_IPC_LOCK capability).

#include <sys/shm.h>

void *shmat(int shmid, const void *shmaddr, int shmflg);

int shmdt(const void *shmaddr);
```

介绍
```
DESCRIPTION
       shmat() attaches the System V shared memory segment identified by shmid to the address space of the calling process.  The attaching address is specified by shmaddr with one of the following criteria:

       If shmaddr is NULL, the system chooses a suitable (unused) address at which to attach the segment.

       If  shmaddr  isn't  NULL  and  SHM_RND is specified in shmflg, the attach occurs at the address equal to shmaddr rounded down to the nearest multiple of SHMLBA.  Otherwise shmaddr must be a page-aligned address at which the
       attach occurs.

       If SHM_RDONLY is specified in shmflg, the segment is attached for reading and the process must have read permission for the segment.  Otherwise the segment is attached for read and write and the process must have  read  and
       write permission for the segment.  There is no notion of a write-only shared memory segment.

       The  (Linux-specific)  SHM_REMAP  flag  may be specified in shmflg to indicate that the mapping of the segment should replace any existing mapping in the range starting at shmaddr and continuing for the size of the segment.
       (Normally an EINVAL error would result if a mapping already exists in this address range.)  In this case, shmaddr must not be NULL.

       The brk(2) value of the calling process is not altered by the attach.  The segment will automatically be detached at process exit.  The same segment may be attached as a read and as a read-write one, and more than once,  in
       the process's address space.

       A successful shmat() call updates the members of the shmid_ds structure (see shmctl(2)) associated with the shared memory segment as follows:

              shm_atime is set to the current time.

              shm_lpid is set to the process-ID of the calling process.

              shm_nattch is incremented by one.

       shmdt()  detaches  the  shared memory segment located at the address specified by shmaddr from the address space of the calling process.  The to-be-detached segment must be currently attached with shmaddr equal to the value
       returned by the attaching shmat() call.

       On a successful shmdt() call the system updates the members of the shmid_ds structure associated with the shared memory segment as follows:

              shm_dtime is set to the current time.

              shm_lpid is set to the process-ID of the calling process.

              shm_nattch is decremented by one.  If it becomes 0 and the segment is marked for deletion, the segment is deleted.

       After a fork(2) the child inherits the attached shared memory segments.

       After an execve(2) all attached shared memory segments are detached from the process.

       Upon _exit(2) all attached shared memory segments are detached from the process.

RETURN VALUE
       On success shmat() returns the address of the attached shared memory segment; on error (void *) -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the cause of the error.

       On success shmdt() returns 0; on error -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the cause of the error.

ERRORS
       When shmat() fails, errno is set to one of the following:

       EACCES The calling process does not have the required permissions for the requested attach type, and does not have the CAP_IPC_OWNER capability.

       EIDRM  shmid points to a removed identifier.

       EINVAL Invalid shmid value, unaligned (i.e., not page-aligned and SHM_RND was not specified) or invalid shmaddr value, or can't attach segment at shmaddr, or SHM_REMAP was specified and shmaddr was NULL.

       ENOMEM Could not allocate memory for the descriptor or for the page tables.

       When shmdt() fails, errno is set as follows:

       EINVAL There is no shared memory segment attached at shmaddr; or, shmaddr is not aligned on a page boundary.

签名
```c
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/shm.h>

int shmctl(int shmid, int cmd, struct shmid_ds *buf);
```

介绍
```
DESCRIPTION
       shmctl() performs the control operation specified by cmd on the System V shared memory segment whose identifier is given in shmid.

       The buf argument is a pointer to a shmid_ds structure, defined in <sys/shm.h> as follows:

           struct shmid_ds {
               struct ipc_perm shm_perm;    /* Ownership and permissions */
               size_t          shm_segsz;   /* Size of segment (bytes) */
               time_t          shm_atime;   /* Last attach time */
               time_t          shm_dtime;   /* Last detach time */
               time_t          shm_ctime;   /* Last change time */
               pid_t           shm_cpid;    /* PID of creator */
               pid_t           shm_lpid;    /* PID of last shmat(2)/shmdt(2) */
               shmatt_t        shm_nattch;  /* No. of current attaches */
               ...
           };

       The ipc_perm structure is defined as follows (the highlighted fields are settable using IPC_SET):

           struct ipc_perm {
               key_t          __key;    /* Key supplied to shmget(2) */
               uid_t          uid;      /* Effective UID of owner */
               gid_t          gid;      /* Effective GID of owner */
               uid_t          cuid;     /* Effective UID of creator */
               gid_t          cgid;     /* Effective GID of creator */
               unsigned short mode;     /* Permissions + SHM_DEST and
                                           SHM_LOCKED flags */
               unsigned short __seq;    /* Sequence number */
           };

       Valid values for cmd are:

       IPC_STAT  Copy information from the kernel data structure associated with shmid into the shmid_ds structure pointed to by buf.  The caller must have read permission on the shared memory segment.

       IPC_SET   Write  the  values of some members of the shmid_ds structure pointed to by buf to the kernel data structure associated with this shared memory segment, updating also its shm_ctime member.  The following fields can
                 be changed: shm_perm.uid, shm_perm.gid, and (the least significant 9 bits of) shm_perm.mode.  The effective UID of the calling process must match the owner (shm_perm.uid) or creator (shm_perm.cuid) of  the  shared
                 memory segment, or the caller must be privileged.

       IPC_RMID  Mark  the  segment to be destroyed.  The segment will only actually be destroyed after the last process detaches it (i.e., when the shm_nattch member of the associated structure shmid_ds is zero).  The caller must
                 be the owner or creator, or be privileged.  If a segment has been marked for destruction, then the (nonstandard) SHM_DEST flag of the shm_perm.mode field in the associated data structure retrieved by IPC_STAT will
                 be set.

                 The caller must ensure that a segment is eventually destroyed; otherwise its pages that were faulted in will remain in memory or swap.

                 See also the description of /proc/sys/kernel/shm_rmid_forced in proc(5).

       IPC_INFO (Linux-specific)
                 Returns  information  about  system-wide  shared  memory  limits  and  parameters  in  the  structure pointed to by buf.  This structure is of type shminfo (thus, a cast is required), defined in <sys/shm.h> if the
                 _GNU_SOURCE feature test macro is defined:

                     struct  shminfo {
                         unsigned long shmmax; /* Maximum segment size */

                         unsigned long shmall; /* Maximum number of pages of
                                                  shared memory, system-wide */
                     };

                 The shmmni, shmmax, and shmall settings can be changed via /proc files of the same name; see proc(5) for details.

       SHM_INFO (Linux-specific)
                 Returns a shm_info structure whose fields contain information about system resources consumed by shared memory.  This structure is defined in <sys/shm.h> if the _GNU_SOURCE feature test macro is defined:

                     struct shm_info {
                         int           used_ids; /* # of currently existing
                                                    segments */
                         unsigned long shm_tot;  /* Total number of shared
                                                    memory pages */
                         unsigned long shm_rss;  /* # of resident shared
                                                    memory pages */
                         unsigned long shm_swp;  /* # of swapped shared
                                                    memory pages */
                         unsigned long swap_attempts;
                                                 /* Unused since Linux 2.4 */
                         unsigned long swap_successes;
                                                 /* Unused since Linux 2.4 */
                     };

       SHM_STAT (Linux-specific)
                 Returns a shmid_ds structure as for IPC_STAT.  However, the shmid argument is not a segment identifier, but instead an index into the kernel's internal array that maintains information about all shared memory seg‐
                 ments on the system.

       The caller can prevent or allow swapping of a shared memory segment with the following cmd values:

       SHM_LOCK (Linux-specific)
                 Prevent swapping of the shared memory segment.  The caller must fault in any pages that are required to be present after locking is enabled.  If a segment has been locked, then the (nonstandard) SHM_LOCKED flag of
                 the shm_perm.mode field in the associated data structure retrieved by IPC_STAT will be set.

       SHM_UNLOCK (Linux-specific)
                 Unlock the segment, allowing it to be swapped out.

       In kernels before 2.6.10, only a privileged process could employ SHM_LOCK and SHM_UNLOCK.  Since kernel 2.6.10, an unprivileged process can employ these operations if its effective UID matches the owner or  creator  UID  of
       the segment, and (for SHM_LOCK) the amount of memory to be locked falls within the RLIMIT_MEMLOCK resource limit (see setrlimit(2)).

RETURN VALUE
       A  successful  IPC_INFO  or  SHM_INFO operation returns the index of the highest used entry in the kernel's internal array recording information about all shared memory segments.  (This information can be used with repeated
       SHM_STAT operations to obtain information about all shared memory segments on the system.)  A successful SHM_STAT operation returns the identifier of the shared memory segment whose index was given in shmid.   Other  opera‐
       tions return 0 on success.

       On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.
ERRORS
       EACCES IPC_STAT or SHM_STAT is requested and shm_perm.mode does not allow read access for shmid, and the calling process does not have the CAP_IPC_OWNER capability.

       EFAULT The argument cmd has value IPC_SET or IPC_STAT but the address pointed to by buf isn't accessible.

       EIDRM  shmid points to a removed identifier.

       EINVAL shmid is not a valid identifier, or cmd is not a valid command.  Or: for a SHM_STAT operation, the index value specified in shmid referred to an array slot that is currently unused.

       ENOMEM (In  kernels  since  2.6.9), SHM_LOCK was specified and the size of the to-be-locked segment would mean that the total bytes in locked shared memory segments would exceed the limit for the real user ID of the calling
              process.  This limit is defined by the RLIMIT_MEMLOCK soft resource limit (see setrlimit(2)).

       EOVERFLOW
              IPC_STAT is attempted, and the GID or UID value is too large to be stored in the structure pointed to by buf.

       EPERM  IPC_SET or IPC_RMID is attempted, and the effective user ID of the calling process is not that of the creator (found in shm_perm.cuid), or the owner (found in shm_perm.uid), and the process was not privileged (Linux:
              did not have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability).

              Or  (in  kernels  before  2.6.9),  SHM_LOCK  or  SHM_UNLOCK  was  specified, but the process was not privileged (Linux: did not have the CAP_IPC_LOCK capability).  (Since Linux 2.6.9, this error can also occur if the
              RLIMIT_MEMLOCK is 0 and the caller is not privileged.)

## 各种IPC方式的比较
* 速度
	* shm： 快，但如果swap到硬盘的话会大大降低速度
	* 文件、FIFO： 相对慢
* 连接/无连接
	* socket： 根据socket类型而定，流socket面向连接而数据报socket则不是
	* 文件、shm： 无
	* FIFO： 要求建立连接，W/R都互相等待对方（至少有一个存在）
* 范围/距离
	* socket： IP socket可以与远程...； unix socket只能本机
	* shm： 本机
	* name pipe/FIFIO： 本机
	* 文件： 可以与远程（NFS？）
* 访问限制
	* 文件、FIFO、共享内存、unix socket： 标准的unix FS权限
	* IP socket： 不能，需要上层自行支持
* 竞态条件
	* shm： 前面提到了，需要用其他机制来保证
	* 文件： 虽然有文件锁支持，但使用不够方便。
	* FIFO、socket： 内核来管理

# 进程之间的分工合作

## 文件锁
两种类型的（文件）锁：
* 写锁
* 读锁

几点：
* 文件锁不是必须使用；
* F_SETLKW时，写操作需要等到所有的读锁都释放； 读操作也需要等到所有的（其实只会一个，写锁互斥）写锁都释放

### unix提供的几种文件锁使用方式
* flock
* lockf
* fcntl - 最灵活、可移植性最好
> `fcntl(fd, F_SETLKW, &lockinfo)`
> F_SETLKW表示如果需要的话会进行等待（锁被其他占有者释放）
> ```c
> void set_read_lock(int fd)
> {
>     struct flock lockinfo;
>     lockinfo.l_type = F_RDLCK;  // 加读锁
>     lockinfo.l_pid = getpid();
>     lockinfo.l_start = 0;
>     lockinfo.l_whence = SEEK_SET;
>     lockinfo.l_len = 0;
>     fcntl(fd, F_SETLKW, &lockinfo);
> }
> ```
> 加写锁： l_type设为F_WRLCK 然后 ...
> 释放锁： l_type设为F_UNLCK 然后 ...
> 只锁住一部分： l_start设为需要的偏移量； l_len设为需要锁住的长度

### 相关的系统调用

```c
/* The structure describing an advisory lock.  This is the type of the third
   argument to `fcntl' for the F_GETLK, F_SETLK, and F_SETLKW requests.  */
struct flock
  {
    __off_t l_start;	/* Offset where the lock begins.  */
    __off_t l_len;	/* Size of the locked area; zero means until EOF.  */
    __pid_t l_pid;	/* Process holding the lock.  */
    short int l_type;	/* Type of lock: F_RDLCK, F_WRLCK, or F_UNLCK.  */
    short 
```

## 信号量（semaphore）
本质是一个内核变量，可以被系统中任何进程访问。
进程间可以用信号量来协调对于共享资源（如shm）的访问。

### 使用
跟shm有些类似：
* owner
	1. semget 得到一个信号量集的标示符（int）（一样的，带上IPC_CREAT）
	2. semctl 为信号量设置值
	3. PV - semop
		* wait时做减一操作，可能阻塞到“不为0”时
		* release做+1操作
	4. semctl 删除信号量
* user
	1. semget 得到一个信号量集的标示符（int）（一样的，不带IPC_CREAT）
	2. PV
		* wait时做减一操作，可能阻塞到“不为0”时
		* release做+1操作

如果是rwlock场景的话
* writer
	* wait时，等read sem为0然后write sem +1  **#yonka#** 这里好像没考虑多写不能并发的要求
	* release时，write sem -1
* reader
	* wait时，等write sem为0，然后read sem +1
	* release时，read sem -1

几点
* semop用于做sem相关操作，sembuf则是操作信息。 详见下面函数和数据结构解释
* semset 信号量集的概念，可以原子的对semset中的多个sem进行操作（读写锁）
* semop时，提供了 sem_op = 0 表示 `wait-for-zero`； sem_op = +1 表示 +1操作； sem_op = -1 表示 -1操作
* 注意到没有`wait-for-non-zero`操作，因为不允许信号量为负，所以也即没有`wait-for-positive`操作，可以考虑用-1然后+1的方式（为0时如果-1会阻塞，直到为1）来实现（= = ）

#### semget
semget - get a System V semaphore set identifier

签名
```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/sem.h>

int semget(key_t key, int nsems, int semflg);
```

介绍
```
DESCRIPTION
       The  semget() system call returns the System V semaphore set identifier associated with the argument key.  A new set of nsems semaphores is created if key has the value IPC_PRIVATE or if no existing semaphore set is associ‐
       ated with key and IPC_CREAT is specified in semflg.

       If semflg specifies both IPC_CREAT and IPC_EXCL and a semaphore set already exists for key, then semget() fails with errno set to EEXIST.  (This is analogous to the effect of the combination O_CREAT | O_EXCL for open(2).)

       Upon creation, the least significant 9 bits of the argument semflg define the permissions (for owner, group and others) for the semaphore set.  These bits have the same format, and the same meaning, as the mode argument  of
       open(2) (though the execute permissions are not meaningful for semaphores, and write permissions mean permission to alter semaphore values).

       The  values of the semaphores in a newly created set are indeterminate.  (POSIX.1-2001 is explicit on this point.)  Although Linux, like many other implementations, initializes the semaphore values to 0, a portable applica‐
       tion cannot rely on this: it should explicitly initialize the semaphores to the desired values.

       When creating a new semaphore set, semget() initializes the set's associated data structure, semid_ds (see semctl(2)), as follows:

              sem_perm.cuid and sem_perm.uid are set to the effective user ID of the calling process.

              sem_perm.cgid and sem_perm.gid are set to the effective group ID of the calling process.

              The least significant 9 bits of sem_perm.mode are set to the least significant 9 bits of semflg.

              sem_nsems is set to the value of nsems.

              sem_otime is set to 0.

              sem_ctime is set to the current time.

       The argument nsems can be 0 (a don't care) when a semaphore set is not being created.  Otherwise nsems must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the maximum number of semaphores per semaphore set (SEMMSL).

       If the semaphore set already exists, the permissions are verified.

RETURN VALUE
       If successful, the return value will be the semaphore set identifier (a nonnegative integer), otherwise -1 is returned, with errno indicating the error.

ERRORS
       On failure errno will be set to one of the following:

       EACCES A semaphore set exists for key, but the calling process does not have permission to access the set, and does not have the CAP_IPC_OWNER capability.

       EEXIST A semaphore set exists for key and semflg specified both IPC_CREAT and IPC_EXCL.

       EINVAL nsems is less than 0 or greater than the limit on the number of semaphores per semaphore set (SEMMSL), or a semaphore set corresponding to key already exists, and nsems is larger than the number of semaphores in that
              set.

       ENOENT No semaphore set exists for key and semflg did not specify IPC_CREAT.

       ENOMEM A semaphore set has to be created but the system does not have enough memory for the new data structure.

       ENOSPC A semaphore set has to be created but the system limit for the maximum number of semaphore sets (SEMMNI), or the system wide maximum number of semaphores (SEMMNS), would be exceeded.

#### semctl
semctl - System V semaphore control operations

签名
```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/ipc.h>
#include <sys/sem.h>

int semctl(int semid, int semnum, int cmd, ...);
```

介绍
```
DESCRIPTION
       semctl() performs the control operation specified by cmd on the System V semaphore set identified by semid, or on the semnum-th semaphore of that set.  (The semaphores in a set are numbered starting at 0.)

       This function has three or four arguments, depending on cmd.  When there are four, the fourth has the type union semun.  The calling program must define this union as follows:

           union semun {
               int              val;    /* Value for SETVAL */
               struct semid_ds *buf;    /* Buffer for IPC_STAT, IPC_SET */
               unsigned short  *array;  /* Array for GETALL, SETALL */
               struct seminfo  *__buf;  /* Buffer for IPC_INFO
                                           (Linux-specific) */
           };

       The semid_ds data structure is defined in <sys/sem.h> as follows:

           struct semid_ds {
               struct ipc_perm sem_perm;  /* Ownership and permissions */
               time_t          sem_otime; /* Last semop time */
               time_t          sem_ctime; /* Last change time */
               unsigned long   sem_nsems; /* No. of semaphores in set */
           };

       The ipc_perm structure is defined as follows (the highlighted fields are settable using IPC_SET):

           struct ipc_perm {
               key_t          __key; /* Key supplied to semget(2) */
               uid_t          uid;   /* Effective UID of owner */
               gid_t          gid;   /* Effective GID of owner */
               uid_t          cuid;  /* Effective UID of creator */
               gid_t          cgid;  /* Effective GID of creator */
               unsigned short mode;  /* Permissions */
               unsigned short __seq; /* Sequence number */
           };

       Valid values for cmd are:

       IPC_STAT  Copy information from the kernel data structure associated with semid into the semid_ds structure pointed to by arg.buf.  The argument semnum is ignored.  The calling process must have read permission on the sema‐
                 phore set.

       IPC_SET   Write the values of some members of the semid_ds structure pointed to by arg.buf to the kernel data structure associated with this semaphore set, updating also its sem_ctime member.  The following members  of  the
                 structure  are  updated: sem_perm.uid, sem_perm.gid, and (the least significant 9 bits of) sem_perm.mode.  The effective UID of the calling process must match the owner (sem_perm.uid) or creator (sem_perm.cuid) of
                 the semaphore set, or the caller must be privileged.  The argument semnum is ignored.

       IPC_RMID  Immediately remove the semaphore set, awakening all processes blocked in semop(2) calls on the set (with an error return and errno set to EIDRM).  The effective user ID of the calling process must match  the  cre‐
                 ator or owner of the semaphore set, or the caller must be privileged.  The argument semnum is ignored.

       IPC_INFO (Linux-specific)
                 Returns  information  about system-wide semaphore limits and parameters in the structure pointed to by arg.__buf.  This structure is of type seminfo, defined in <sys/sem.h> if the _GNU_SOURCE feature test macro is
                 defined:
                     struct  seminfo {
                         int semmap;  /* Number of entries in semaphore
                                         map; unused within kernel */
                         int semmni;  /* Maximum number of semaphore sets */
                         int semmns;  /* Maximum number of semaphores in all
                                         semaphore sets */
                         int semmnu;  /* System-wide maximum number of undo
                                         structures; unused within kernel */
                         int semmsl;  /* Maximum number of semaphores in a
                                         set */
                         int semopm;  /* Maximum number of operations for
                                         semop(2) */
                         int semume;  /* Maximum number of undo entries per
                                         process; unused within kernel */
                         int semusz;  /* Size of struct sem_undo */
                         int semvmx;  /* Maximum semaphore value */
                         int semaem;  /* Max. value that can be recorded for
                                         semaphore adjustment (SEM_UNDO) */
                     };

                 The semmsl, semmns, semopm, and semmni settings can be changed via /proc/sys/kernel/sem; see proc(5) for details.

       SEM_INFO (Linux-specific)
                 Returns a seminfo structure containing the same information as for IPC_INFO, except that the following fields are returned with information about system resources consumed by semaphores: the semusz  field  returns
                 the number of semaphore sets that currently exist on the system; and the semaem field returns the total number of semaphores in all semaphore sets on the system.

       SEM_STAT (Linux-specific)
                 Returns  a  semid_ds structure as for IPC_STAT.  However, the semid argument is not a semaphore identifier, but instead an index into the kernel's internal array that maintains information about all semaphore sets
                 on the system.

       GETALL    Return semval (i.e., the current value) for all semaphores of the set into arg.array.  The argument semnum is ignored.  The calling process must have read permission on the semaphore set.

       GETNCNT   The system call returns the value of semncnt for the semnum-th semaphore of the set (i.e., the number of processes waiting for an increase of semval for the semnum-th semaphore of the set).   The  calling  process
                 must have read permission on the semaphore set.

       GETPID    The  system  call returns the value of sempid for the semnum-th semaphore of the set (i.e., the PID of the process that executed the last semop(2) call for the semnum-th semaphore of the set).  The calling process
                 must have read permission on the semaphore set.

       GETVAL    The system call returns the value of semval for the semnum-th semaphore of the set.  The calling process must have read permission on the semaphore set.

       GETZCNT   The system call returns the value of semzcnt for the semnum-th semaphore of the set (i.e., the number of processes waiting for semval of the semnum-th semaphore of the set to become 0).  The calling  process  must
                 have read permission on the semaphore set.

       SETALL    Set  semval  for  all semaphores of the set using arg.array, updating also the sem_ctime member of the semid_ds structure associated with the set.  Undo entries (see semop(2)) are cleared for altered semaphores in
                 all processes.  If the changes to semaphore values would permit blocked semop(2) calls in other processes to proceed, then those processes are woken up.  The argument semnum is ignored.  The calling  process  must
                 have alter (write) permission on the semaphore set.

       SETVAL    Set  the value of semval to arg.val for the semnum-th semaphore of the set, updating also the sem_ctime member of the semid_ds structure associated with the set.  Undo entries are cleared for altered semaphores in
                 all processes.  If the changes to semaphore values would permit blocked semop(2) calls in other processes to proceed, then those processes are woken up.  The calling process must have alter permission on the sema‐
                 phore set.

RETURN VALUE
       On failure semctl() returns -1 with errno indicating the error.

       Otherwise the system call returns a nonnegative value depending on cmd as follows:

       GETNCNT     the value of semncnt.

       GETPID      the value of sempid.
       GETVAL      the value of semval.

       GETZCNT     the value of semzcnt.

       IPC_INFO    the index of the highest used entry in the kernel's internal array recording information about all semaphore sets.  (This information can be used with repeated SEM_STAT operations to obtain information about all
                   semaphore sets on the system.)

       SEM_INFO    As for IPC_INFO.

       SEM_STAT    the identifier of the semaphore set whose index was given in semid.

       All other cmd values return 0 on success.

ERRORS
       On failure, errno will be set to one of the following:

       EACCES The argument cmd has one of the values GETALL, GETPID, GETVAL, GETNCNT, GETZCNT, IPC_STAT, SEM_STAT, SETALL, or SETVAL and the calling process does not have the required permissions on the semaphore set and does  not
              have the CAP_IPC_OWNER capability.

       EFAULT The address pointed to by arg.buf or arg.array isn't accessible.

       EIDRM  The semaphore set was removed.

       EINVAL Invalid value for cmd or semid.  Or: for a SEM_STAT operation, the index value specified in semid referred to an array slot that is currently unused.

       EPERM  The argument cmd has the value IPC_SET or IPC_RMID but the effective user ID of the calling process is not the creator (as found in sem_perm.cuid) or the owner (as found in sem_perm.uid) of the semaphore set, and the
              process does not have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.

       ERANGE The argument cmd has the value SETALL or SETVAL and the value to which semval is to be set (for some semaphore of the set) is less than 0 or greater than the implementation limit SEMVMX.

介绍
```
DESCRIPTION
       Each semaphore in a System V semaphore set has the following associated values:

           unsigned short  semval;   /* semaphore value */
           unsigned short  semzcnt;  /* # waiting for zero */
           unsigned short  semncnt;  /* # waiting for increase */
           pid_t           sempid;   /* ID of process that did last op */

       semop()  performs  operations  on selected semaphores in the set indicated by semid.  Each of the nsops elements in the array pointed to by sops specifies an operation to be performed on a single semaphore.  The elements of
       this structure are of type struct sembuf, containing the following members:

           unsigned short sem_num;  /* semaphore number */
           short          sem_op;   /* semaphore operation */
           short          sem_flg;  /* operation flags */

       Flags recognized in sem_flg are IPC_NOWAIT and SEM_UNDO.  If an operation specifies SEM_UNDO, it will be automatically undone when the process terminates.

       The set of operations contained in sops is performed in array order, and atomically, that is, the operations are performed either as a complete unit, or not at all.  The behavior of the system call if not all operations can
       be performed immediately depends on the presence of the IPC_NOWAIT flag in the individual sem_flg fields, as noted below.

       Each operation is performed on the sem_num-th semaphore of the semaphore set, where the first semaphore of the set is numbered 0.  There are three types of operation, distinguished by the value of sem_op.

       If  sem_op is a positive integer, the operation adds this value to the semaphore value (semval).  Furthermore, if SEM_UNDO is specified for this operation, the system subtracts the value sem_op from the semaphore adjustment
       (semadj) value for this semaphore.  This operation can always proceed—it never forces a thread to wait.  The calling process must have alter permission on the semaphore set.

       If sem_op is zero, the process must have read permission on the semaphore set.  This is a "wait-for-zero" operation: if semval is zero, the operation can immediately  proceed.   Otherwise,  if  IPC_NOWAIT  is  specified  in
       sem_flg,  semop()  fails  with errno set to EAGAIN (and none of the operations in sops is performed).  Otherwise semzcnt (the count of threads waiting until this semaphore's value becomes zero) is incremented by one and the
       thread sleeps until one of the following occurs:

       ·  semval becomes 0, at which time the value of semzcnt is decremented.

       ·  The semaphore set is removed: semop() fails, with errno set to EIDRM.

       ·  The calling thread catches a signal: the value of semzcnt is decremented and semop() fails, with errno set to EINTR.

       ·  The time limit specified by timeout in a semtimedop() call expires: semop() fails, with errno set to EAGAIN.

       If sem_op is less than zero, the process must have alter permission on the semaphore set.  If semval is greater than or equal to the absolute value of sem_op, the operation can proceed immediately:  the  absolute  value  of
       sem_op  is  subtracted  from  semval,  and,  if SEM_UNDO is specified for this operation, the system adds the absolute value of sem_op to the semaphore adjustment (semadj) value for this semaphore.  If the absolute value of
       sem_op is greater than semval, and IPC_NOWAIT is specified in sem_flg, semop() fails, with errno set to EAGAIN (and none of the operations in sops is performed).  Otherwise semncnt (the counter of threads waiting  for  this
       semaphore's value to increase) is incremented by one and the thread sleeps until one of the following occurs:

       ·  semval becomes greater than or equal to the absolute value of sem_op: the operation now proceeds, as described above.

       ·  The semaphore set is removed from the system: semop() fails, with errno set to EIDRM.

       ·  The calling thread catches a signal: the value of semncnt is decremented and semop() fails, with errno set to EINTR.

       ·  The time limit specified by timeout in a semtimedop() call expires: the system call fails, with errno set to EAGAIN.

       On successful completion, the sempid value for each semaphore specified in the array pointed to by sops is set to the caller's process ID.  In addition, the sem_otime is set to the current time.

       semtimedop()  behaves  identically  to  semop()  except that in those cases where the calling thread would sleep, the duration of that sleep is limited by the amount of elapsed time specified by the timespec structure whose
       address is passed in the timeout argument.  (This sleep interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity, and kernel scheduling delays mean that the interval may overrun by a small amount.)  If the specified time
       limit has been reached, semtimedop() fails with errno set to EAGAIN (and none of the operations in sops is performed).  If the timeout argument is NULL, then semtimedop() behaves exactly like semop().

RETURN VALUE
       If successful semop() and semtimedop() return 0; otherwise they return -1 with errno indicating the error.

ERRORS
       On failure, errno is set to one of the following:

       E2BIG  The argument nsops is greater than SEMOPM, the maximum number of operations allowed per system call.

       EACCES The calling process does not have the permissions required to perform the specified semaphore operations, and does not have the CAP_IPC_OWNER capability.

       EAGAIN An operation could not proceed immediately and either IPC_NOWAIT was specified in sem_flg or the time limit specified in timeout expired.

       EFAULT An address specified in either the sops or the timeout argument isn't accessible.

       EFBIG  For some operation the value of sem_num is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the number of semaphores in the set.

       EIDRM  The semaphore set was removed.

       EINTR  While blocked in this system call, the thread caught a signal; see signal(7).

       EINVAL The semaphore set doesn't exist, or semid is less than zero, or nsops has a nonpositive value.

       ENOMEM The sem_flg of some operation specified SEM_UNDO and the system does not have enough memory to allocate the undo structure.

       ERANGE For some operation sem_op+semval is greater than SEMVMX, the implementation dependent maximum value for semval.
